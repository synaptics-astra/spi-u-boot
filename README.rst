Synaptics Astra SPI U-Boot Images
=================================

This repository contains the prebuilt SPI U-Boot images which are installed on the Astra Machine SL16x0 series devices.
These images can be used to update or restore the U-Boot firmware stored on the internal SPI flash located on the core
module.

Instructions on how to flash the SPI U-Boot firmware can be found in the `Synaptics Astra Documentation <https://synaptics-astra.github.io/doc/v/1.0.0/linux/index.html#updating-internal-spi-flash-firmware>`__.
